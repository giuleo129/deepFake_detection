🔍 DeepFake Analysis & Detection

This repository contains projects dedicated to the study and detection of DeepFake images using various machine learning techniques. The research focuses on two main approaches:

Pretrained Neural Networks & Fine-Tuning

Leveraging state-of-the-art models (e.g., AlexNet, GoogleNet, ViT) to classify DeepFake images.
Exploring the potential of fine-tuning to improve model performance.
Fourier-Based SVM Classification

Extracting frequency-domain features from DeepFake images using Fourier analysis.
Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on these transformed features to distinguish different DeepFake generation methods.
The goal is to analyze the effectiveness of these approaches in detecting AI-generated faces and understanding the patterns behind them.

🚀 Stay tuned for updates and results!
