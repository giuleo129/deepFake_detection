# DeepFake Detection Projects

This repository contains projects focused on the study and detection of DeepFake images using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
[DeepFake Dataset](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/Deepfakes/PaperMDPI2022/)

## Approaches

### 1. Pretrained Neural Networks & Fine-Tuning
- Utilized state-of-the-art models such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ViT to classify DeepFake images.  
- Applied fine-tuning to improve model performance.

### 2. Fourier-Based SVM Classification
- Extracted frequency-domain features from DeepFake images using Fourier analysis.  
- Trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on these features to detect AI-generated faces.  
- Evaluated the effectiveness of frequency-based approaches in detecting different DeepFake generation methods.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Scikit-learn  
- Fourier Analysis techniques

## Key Takeaway
These projects demonstrate practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to image forensics, combining deep learning and classical methods to detect AI-generated images.
