dataset link: https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/Deepfakes/PaperMDPI2022/

This repository contains projects dedicated to the study and detection of DeepFake images using various machine learning techniques. The research focuses on two main approaches:

Pretrained Neural Networks & Fine-Tuning:
1- Leveraging state-of-the-art models (e.g., AlexNet, GoogleNet, ViT) to classify DeepFake images.
2- Exploring the potential of fine-tuning to improve model performance.


Fourier-Based SVM Classification
1- Extracting frequency-domain features from DeepFake images using Fourier analysis.
2- Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on these transformed features to distinguish different DeepFake generation methods.
3- The goal is to analyze the effectiveness of these approaches in detecting AI-generated faces and understanding the patterns behind them.

🚀 Stay tuned for updates and results!
